# Github Actions

GitHub Actions is an automation platform built into GitHub, used to automate tasks within your software development workflow. Itâ€™s commonly used for CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment).

## Getting Started

Create workflows files in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository. Each workflow is defined in a YAML file.
```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
touch .github/workflows/main.yml
```
